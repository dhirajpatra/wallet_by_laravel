### Create small model of a physical money wallet using Laravel Framework

* User should register and login to the system: you need to implement user registration and login flow.

* There should be 2 ways of registration: via email & via google or facebook.

* To be able to log in the user has to verify his/her account from the email he/she gets.

* When logged in for the first time user should be able to add his wallet in order to continue (think at it of UX perspective)

* Wallets should have name and type (examples: credit card, cash), note that user can add as many wallets as wanted.

* After adding wallets user should be able to add records.

* Records can be of Credit or Debit types. User should chose the wallet of which to remove or to add a specific amount.

* Don't forget to show total balance, and the balance of each wallet and update it in a separate

* Reporting section.

* Write appropriate unit tests
